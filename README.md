# 🖼️ Skin Lesion Binary Classification (PART 1)

## 📚 Overview
Binary classification of skin lesions to distinguish **melanoma** (malignant) from **non-melanoma** (benign).
This is a first part of a the Skin Lesion Classification project

## 🧰 Methods
- **Preprocessing**: Intensity scaling, image resizing, black border and hair removal.
- **Feature Extraction**: Color features, texture analysis (GLCM, LBP, entropy, kurtosis, contrast), Gabor filters.
- **Classification**: Machine learning models optimized for accuracy, precision, and recall.

## 📈 Results
Promising performance in melanoma detection with high accuracy.
Received a 0.83 accuracy on unseen test data
